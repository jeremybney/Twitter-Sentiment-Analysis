# Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis
NLP + Twitter API = Sentiment Analysis

## Set Up
You will need to know your `consumer key` and `consumer secret` from your Twitter API as well as your `access_token` and `access_token_secret` which you can retrieve by creating a new application with your Twitter developer account. 

## Packages
Requires tweepy and TextBlob

## Hashtag Search
Modify #Trump to be whatever you want. Depending on your credentials you might be limited to a few hundred or thousand of the most recent tweets. There are a few workarounds.
